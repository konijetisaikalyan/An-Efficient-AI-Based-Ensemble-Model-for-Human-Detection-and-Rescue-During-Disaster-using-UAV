Algorithm: UAV_Human_Detection(FOCAL_LENGTH, KNOWN_HEIGHT_CM)

Input: FOCAL_LENGTH, KNOWN_HEIGHT_CM
Output: Video stream with detected humans and distance estimates

begin
    Initialize HOG descriptor and SVM detector
    Initialize video capture from webcam
    Initialize video writer for output

    while True do
        Capture frame from video stream
        Resize frame to 640x480
        Convert frame to grayscale
        
        Detect people in the frame using HOG-SVM
        
        for each detected person do
            Calculate distance using:
                distance = (KNOWN_HEIGHT_CM * FOCAL_LENGTH) / person_height
            
            Draw bounding box around the person
            Display calculated distance on frame
        end for
        
        Write frame to output video
        Display frame
        
        if 'q' key is pressed then
            break
        end if
    end while

    Release video capture and writer
    Close all windows
end

Output: Processed video with human detections and distance estimates
